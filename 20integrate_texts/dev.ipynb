A possible influence on life processes was already mentioned in the late 19 th  century [ 1 ]. It is now recognized, that many organisms are capable of perceiving such fields, while less is known on the elementary perception. Three types of mechanisms are considered therefore, the orientation of ferromagnetic particles in tissues [ 2 ], singlet-triplet mixing states of macromolecules building radical pairs [ 3 ], and the ICR, whose persistent investigation began with the works of Liboff [ 4 ]. Ferromagnetism has been implicated in animal navigation (e.g. compass mechanism of migratory birds [ 5 ], and the magnetotaxis of certain bacteria [ 6 ]. The radical pair mechanism is independent of ferromagnetism and has putatively a higher magnetic sensitivity. It has been primarily studied in photosynthetic reaction centers and the respiratory chain [ 7 ], where triplet yields are modulated by electromagnetic interaction with fields as low as about 50 μT [ 8 ]. Already two decades ago effects were described by Blackman  et al.  [ 9 ], and later by [ 10 - 12 ], which require a combination of static and alternating magnetic fields. It turned out, that the magnetic field strength  B  of the static component and the frequency  f  of the alternating EMF relate to the \"ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) formula\": whereas  m  is the mass and  q  the charge of ions involved. The explanation of the mechanism of this effect in an aqueous, more or less viscous environment seems to be difficult, nevertheless there are some efforts. Liboff [ 13 ] suggested that magnetic fields can interact in a resonant manner with endogenous AC electric fields in biological systems, instead of a direct interaction with external AC magnetic fields. Binhi [ 14 ] reviewed the mechanisms of magnetobiological effects, and tried to estimate the sensitivities and involved molecular topologies. Adair [ 15 ] questioned a model involving altered transition rates of excited ions by weak EMF, while others [ 16 ] consider the ionic environment, eg. properties of the water, with Ca 2+  as the most investigated ion. An altered Ca 2+ -transport was found in human lymphocytes [ 4 ]. The motility of benthic diatoms is effected, if ICR conditions are matched for Ca 2+  and K +  in the range of 8–64 Hz, and static field strengths comparable to geomagnetic fields [ 17 ]. The germination rate of  Raphanus sativus  was altered, when the ICR conditions for Ca 2+ , K +  and Mg 2+  were applied to the seedlings [ 18 ]. ELF effects on macromolecules indicate an ICR effect possibly caused by additionally involved alternating electric fields [ 19 ]. It is noteworthy remarkable that ICR conditions can be matched by combinations of the local geomagnetic field and man-made electromagnetic fields, especially the frequency range of power lines (50 or 60 Hz). Liboff  et al.  [ 20 ] suggest to consider ICR effects for the evaluation of epidemiological childhood leukaemia studies. The assessment of elevated brain cancer risk has been evaluated by Aldrich  et al.  [ 21 ] on the assumption of interactions of the geomagnetic field and a 60 Hz field component from power lines. NLDS was developed during the past decade in order to investigate dielectric properties of small particles in aqueous solutions, using relatively simple electrochemical equipment. In the simplest case, a sinusoidal alternating electric field is applied to the solution by 2 electrodes, using peak to peak voltages up to 1.5 V and frequencies of 1 to 1000 Hz. Particles with a dielectric constant different from that of their environment (generally water) distort the field. This induces alternating voltages over and currents through the solution, which are detected by 2 auxiliary electrodes in order to avoid polarisation effects. Phase shifts and distortions of the obtained signals, as compared to the input signal, contain information on damping and relaxation kinetics. Therefore, the signals are  Fourier -transformed and evaluated as power spectra in the frequency domain [ 22 - 24 ]. Usually, the sample is compared to a reference, which lacks the solute, but otherwise is identical. Sample and reference can either be measured one by one in a single chamber device, or simultaneous with a \"dual-chamber\" setup, which also needs a two channel data acquisition, and allows a real-time differential-NLDS (DNLDS). The data are usually calculated using the decibel (dB) scale for the intensity (power)  P n : Where U(n) sample  is the signal output intensity of the n th  harmonic from the sample measuring channel, and U(n) ref  the corresponding value from the reference channel. Zhadin  et al.  [ 25 ] reported the alteration of electric properties of an electrolyte under ICR conditions. They found an increasing ion current through an aqueous glutamic acid (Glu) solution in narrow frequency bands (resonance), which could be described by equation (1). These results are the starting point for the present work, which is aimed to further elucidate this conduction mechanism. The influence of the concentration of Glu has been investigated, and the time resolved electric current through the solution is analyzed using \"non linear dielectric spectroscopy\" (NLDS), which indicate microcolloidial properties of the solvent-solute system. The NLDS was amplified by two features: The option of simultaneous data acquisition in two cuvettes (DNLDS), and the frequency resolved voltammetry (FRV), whereby simultaneous a AC voltammetry is performed [ 26 ]. By recording NLDS spectra at varying electrode voltages from e.g. 100–1100 mV, additional information was obtained on redox potentials. The electrode current never increases proportionally with the applied voltage but remains constant in the range of the counter voltage to an existing redox potential given by the investigated electrode-electrolyte system. This was used to improve the method by recording differential spectra (DNLDS). The integral over the spectrum represents one data point of a simple (not frequency resolved) AC voltammetry, while the intensity course of corresponding spectral data points provide information about the dielectric state of the redox reaction, e.g. its capacitive, time-dependent properties.\\nBackground\\nWeak magnetic fields and extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) are omnipresent in natural environmental and increasingly man-made factors.

The solutions were degassed and stored under Argon, in order to avoid oxidation of the solute and increased electrode fouling during the subsequent measurements. An acidic solution of 2.24 mM Glu was adjusted to pH = 2.85 ± 0.03 with a stock solution of 5 mM HCl. Equilibration was assumed, when the pH varied less than ± 0.03 for at least one minute. All procedures were performed at 20°C. For yielding a reference signal, an aqueous solution of HCl was provided by diluting the HCl stock solution with water to pH = 2.85. All solutions were stored at 4°C under Argon. Apparatus The experimental arrangement for differential non-linear dielectric spectroscopy (DNLDS) is shown in Figure  1 . It allows the simultaneous evaluation of a sample and a reference under same conditions. A double cuvette (K) is built up by two standard photometric plastic cuvettes (1 × 1 × 4.3 cm). Both contain electrode arrays (E 1 , E 2 ) consisting each of 4 gold wires (Au 99.9%, Johnson Matthey, Karlsruhe) with a diameter of 0.25 mm, mounted parallel at a distance of 2 mm on a teflon frame. The required sample volume was 1 ml. These electrode carriers are mounted on a stable socket for electric connection and mechanical adjustment (not shown). The cuvettes are enclosed by a hermetically sealable plastic tank (T) with a copper bottom, which is filled at a height of 2 cm around the cuvettes with water for thermal coupling to an outer temperature controlled water bath. The setup is kept under Ar atmosphere throughout the experiment. Thermic control (20 ± 0.1 °C) of the cuvettes is provided by a water thermostat (Haake \"G\", Karlsruhe-Berlin, Germany) with a sequential home built temperature fine controller, ensuring highly stable working conditions for the electrodes. Once assembled, these components form a mechanically stable unit, with in- and outlets for gas and samples by small teflon hoses (not shown). The assembly is placed in the center of a solenoid (S), consisting of two cylindrical coils with a inner diameter of 16 cm and a height of 7 cm for applying the vertically orientated EMF (B). The coil for the static field component consisted of 300 turns of coated copper wire (diameter 0.5 mm), the other coil was winded above and had 50 turns. Figure 1 Experimental facility.  Schematic sketch of the arrangement for the differential NLDS (DNLDS) experiments (left, components not drawn to scale) and photograph of the opened permalloy shielding box with the assembled sample carrier (right): Two arrays of 4 gold electrodes ( E 1 ,  E 2 , length 10 mm, distance 2 mm) each are located in two adjacent perspex cuvettes ( C ) of 1 × 1 × 4.3 cm, enabling simultaneous acquisition of two liquid samples (used volume 1 ml each) under the same environmental conditions. The cuvettes are enclosed by a tank ( T ) for providing an Argon protection gas atmosphere. This all is mounted on a socket housing water temperature control and magnetic field monitoring, and is centered inside a cylindrical solenoid ( S ) consisting of 2 coils with a inner diameter of 16 cm and a height of 7 cm for independent generating the static and the alternating magnetic fields of vertical direction ( B ). The input signal to the sample is applied by the electrodes labeled \"in\", the probe signals are taken by the electrodes labeled \"out\" and connected to preamplifiers with symmetric inputs. The complete arrangement is enclosed by a shielding box of 1 mm Permalloy, which is bonded inside with perspex. For electric and magnetic shielding the complete setup resides in a grounded double-walled Permalloy box with a total wall thickness of 1 mm. A overall inhomogeneity ≤ 0.3 % of the generated fields was determined inside the box with a triaxial CXM539 magnetometer (CMT GmbH, Herrsching, Germany) over the cuvette locations. For coil calibration the relation of field strength to coil current could be ascertained directly in measurement series with the magnetometer for 0.1–100 μT, showing a overall deviation from linearity ≤ 0.2 % (DC and AC), so currents corresponding to even lower field strengths were obtained by extrapolation. Signal processing was mostly done as previously described [ 27 ]. Figure  2  shows the schematic circuit diagram of the special NLDS measurement setup used here: The sinusoidal controlling voltage (100–1100 mV) for NLDS with a frequency of 2 Hz was applied to the two outer electrodes by a symmetric amplifier (output impedance 50 Ω). The inner two electrodes were connected to the input ports of a differential preamplifier. Because a simultaneous examination of two samples under same conditions is required, a second identical electrode array with preamplification must be available. The resulting signals were digitized by a computer controlled multi channel DA/AD-converter (Lab-PC+, National Instruments, Austin TX U.S.A.). This board also supplied the voltages for the NLDS and the control of the EMF. A function generator (Krohn-Hite Model 5200) generated the sine curve for the AC magnetic field with a frequency accuracy of 0.1 %. The two operational power amplifiers of a OPA 2541 chip drove the solenoids generating the constant as well as the variable magnetic field components, which were monitored by the coil currents and the magnetometer. Figure 2 NLDS measurement setup (schematic).  The voltage control signal is applied by a symmetric amplifier to the outer two of a plane 4 gold electrode array. The NLDS signal generated by the sample is clamped by the inner two electrodes. It will also be preamplified symmetrically, digitized by a fast computer controlled analog-digital converter and fourier analyzed by the data acquisition software. The static and dynamic magnetic field component is directed parallel to the electrode plane. The measuring station provides two such NLDS setups, enabling a simultaneous examination of two samples under same conditions. For cleaning, the electrodes were first treated with chromosulfuric acid for 1 h at room temperature and intensively rinsed with de-ionized water. This procedure was repeated approximately once per week. An improved long-term electric stability was obtained by slight modifications of the treatments described by Woodward  et al.  [ 23 ] and Yardley  et al.  [ 28 ]: The electrodes were additionally washed with chloroform, sonicated for 20 min in a detergent solution (0.5 % Triton X-100 in water), treated with CaCl 2  (0.5 M in water) in a ultrasonic bath (Bachhofer, Reutlingen), and finally rinsed with de-ionized water (<2 μS). This treatment resulted in amplitude deviations ≤ 5% over an experimental session of up to 2 h. If electrodes were not used for DC measurements, but for NLDS, they were additionally coated with a thin polymer film in order to improve noise reduction and stability [ 24 ]. Measurement techniques The cuvettes could be charged with the test solutions, discharged and rinsed through the teflon hoses by a syringe. A sample volume of 1 ml was used. Device specific, systematic errors were routinely checked by exchanging the electrode arrays used for sample and reference measurements and testing several cuvettes of the same type. After loading they were flooded with Argon for about 10 min. in order to remove O 2  from the solutions, avoid oxidation reactions and subsequent arising of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the solute, then the hoses were sealed with rubber caps. After reaching a stable temperature of 20 ± 0.2°C, measurements were started. First 10 \"dummy\" scans were performed, in order to obtain a dynamic equilibration of the electrodes.  B dc  = 40 μT was selected as static magnetic field component for the ICR condition, because it is of comparable intensity as the natural geomagnetic field of the earth. A new sample was used for every experiment, an \"aging effect\" of the test solutions was observed, similar to an earlier seen effect, which resulted in a decreasing reproducibility for experiments with magnetic field exposed lipid vesicles [ 27 ]. Three types of techniques for measuring the electric currents in the solutions were applied, always using the gold electrode array described above: 1) For the validation of the ICR parameters of the Glu-HCl solution, the experiment of Zhadin  et al.  [ 25 ] was repeated. The DC voltage of 80 mV was applied to the outer electrodes (+40 mV and -40 mV), and the current through the solution was calculated from the resulting voltage between the inner electrodes. The current calibration was earlier performed with 10 mM HCl and the Glu-HCl solution. By that way, used by many established voltammetric techniques [ 29 ], superimposing electrode transition potentials can be widely avoided, in contrary to a direct current measurement with a two electrode system. A constant magnetic field  B dc  = 40 μT or 50 μT and a frequency sweep of the alternating magnetic field  B ac  = 50 nT (parallel to  B dc ) from 2 to 7 Hz with 0.025 Hz/s and a resolution of 0.05 Hz were used. 2) For the investigation of the ICR transition with NLDS the same magnetic field setup is used like described under 1), the NLDS sine wave was applied on the electrodes (instead of the DC-voltage) and a constant magnetic field  B dc  = 40 μT was used. 3) Finally the FRV setup allowed the frequency analysis of the electric signals with variable amplitudes using the DNLDS technique described above. Glu-HCl samples were exposed to constant ICR conditions ( B dc  = 40 μT and  B ac  = 50 nT, 4.14 Hz fixed), for reference experiments only the static component ( B dc  = 40 μT) was applied with  B dc  switched off. The amplitude of the sinusoidal scanning voltage was increased in each experiment from 100–1100 mV in steps of 10 mV, record by record, the duration of each cycle was 4 s. The two data sets (from Glu-HCl and HCl sample) yielded by every single record were seperately Fourier transformed in order to get the spectra, these two spectra were divided by themselves (Glu-HCL spectrum by HCl spectrum) and the ratio spectrum was subsequently attached to a data file on a harddisc for later evaluation.\\nMethods\\nPreparations All preparations were performed with doubly de-ionized water. The solutions were degassed and stored under Argon, in order to avoid oxidation of the solute and increased electrode fouling during the subsequent measurements. An acidic solution of 2.24 mM Glu was adjusted to pH = 2.85 ± 0.03 with a stock solution of 5 mM HCl. Equilibration was assumed, when the pH varied less than ± 0.03 for at least one minute. All procedures were performed at 20°C. For yielding a reference signal, an aqueous solution of HCl was provided by diluting the HCl stock solution with water to pH = 2.85. All solutions were stored at 4°C under Argon.\\nPreparations\\nAll preparations were performed with doubly de-ionized water.

The input signal to the sample is applied by the electrodes labeled \"in\", the probe signals are taken by the electrodes labeled \"out\" and connected to preamplifiers with symmetric inputs. The complete arrangement is enclosed by a shielding box of 1 mm Permalloy, which is bonded inside with perspex. For electric and magnetic shielding the complete setup resides in a grounded double-walled Permalloy box with a total wall thickness of 1 mm. A overall inhomogeneity ≤ 0.3 % of the generated fields was determined inside the box with a triaxial CXM539 magnetometer (CMT GmbH, Herrsching, Germany) over the cuvette locations. For coil calibration the relation of field strength to coil current could be ascertained directly in measurement series with the magnetometer for 0.1–100 μT, showing a overall deviation from linearity ≤ 0.2 % (DC and AC), so currents corresponding to even lower field strengths were obtained by extrapolation. Signal processing was mostly done as previously described [ 27 ]. Figure  2  shows the schematic circuit diagram of the special NLDS measurement setup used here: The sinusoidal controlling voltage (100–1100 mV) for NLDS with a frequency of 2 Hz was applied to the two outer electrodes by a symmetric amplifier (output impedance 50 Ω). The inner two electrodes were connected to the input ports of a differential preamplifier. Because a simultaneous examination of two samples under same conditions is required, a second identical electrode array with preamplification must be available. The resulting signals were digitized by a computer controlled multi channel DA/AD-converter (Lab-PC+, National Instruments, Austin TX U.S.A.). This board also supplied the voltages for the NLDS and the control of the EMF. A function generator (Krohn-Hite Model 5200) generated the sine curve for the AC magnetic field with a frequency accuracy of 0.1 %. The two operational power amplifiers of a OPA 2541 chip drove the solenoids generating the constant as well as the variable magnetic field components, which were monitored by the coil currents and the magnetometer. Figure 2 NLDS measurement setup (schematic).  The voltage control signal is applied by a symmetric amplifier to the outer two of a plane 4 gold electrode array. The NLDS signal generated by the sample is clamped by the inner two electrodes. It will also be preamplified symmetrically, digitized by a fast computer controlled analog-digital converter and fourier analyzed by the data acquisition software. The static and dynamic magnetic field component is directed parallel to the electrode plane. The measuring station provides two such NLDS setups, enabling a simultaneous examination of two samples under same conditions. For cleaning, the electrodes were first treated with chromosulfuric acid for 1 h at room temperature and intensively rinsed with de-ionized water. This procedure was repeated approximately once per week. An improved long-term electric stability was obtained by slight modifications of the treatments described by Woodward  et al.  [ 23 ] and Yardley  et al.  [ 28 ]: The electrodes were additionally washed with chloroform, sonicated for 20 min in a detergent solution (0.5 % Triton X-100 in water), treated with CaCl 2  (0.5 M in water) in a ultrasonic bath (Bachhofer, Reutlingen), and finally rinsed with de-ionized water (<2 μS). This treatment resulted in amplitude deviations ≤ 5% over an experimental session of up to 2 h. If electrodes were not used for DC measurements, but for NLDS, they were additionally coated with a thin polymer film in order to improve noise reduction and stability [ 24 ].\\nApparatus\\nThe experimental arrangement for differential non-linear dielectric spectroscopy (DNLDS) is shown in Figure  1 . It allows the simultaneous evaluation of a sample and a reference under same conditions. A double cuvette (K) is built up by two standard photometric plastic cuvettes (1 × 1 × 4.3 cm). Both contain electrode arrays (E 1 , E 2 ) consisting each of 4 gold wires (Au 99.9%, Johnson Matthey, Karlsruhe) with a diameter of 0.25 mm, mounted parallel at a distance of 2 mm on a teflon frame. The required sample volume was 1 ml. These electrode carriers are mounted on a stable socket for electric connection and mechanical adjustment (not shown). The cuvettes are enclosed by a hermetically sealable plastic tank (T) with a copper bottom, which is filled at a height of 2 cm around the cuvettes with water for thermal coupling to an outer temperature controlled water bath. The setup is kept under Ar atmosphere throughout the experiment. Thermic control (20 ± 0.1 °C) of the cuvettes is provided by a water thermostat (Haake \"G\", Karlsruhe-Berlin, Germany) with a sequential home built temperature fine controller, ensuring highly stable working conditions for the electrodes. Once assembled, these components form a mechanically stable unit, with in- and outlets for gas and samples by small teflon hoses (not shown). The assembly is placed in the center of a solenoid (S), consisting of two cylindrical coils with a inner diameter of 16 cm and a height of 7 cm for applying the vertically orientated EMF (B). The coil for the static field component consisted of 300 turns of coated copper wire (diameter 0.5 mm), the other coil was winded above and had 50 turns.For electric and magnetic shielding the complete setup resides in a grounded double-walled Permalloy box with a total wall thickness of 1 mm. A overall inhomogeneity ≤ 0.3 % of the generated fields was determined inside the box with a triaxial CXM539 magnetometer (CMT GmbH, Herrsching, Germany) over the cuvette locations. For coil calibration the relation of field strength to coil current could be ascertained directly in measurement series with the magnetometer for 0.1–100 μT, showing a overall deviation from linearity ≤ 0.2 % (DC and AC), so currents corresponding to even lower field strengths were obtained by extrapolation.Signal processing was mostly done as previously described [ 27 ]. Figure  2  shows the schematic circuit diagram of the special NLDS measurement setup used here: The sinusoidal controlling voltage (100–1100 mV) for NLDS with a frequency of 2 Hz was applied to the two outer electrodes by a symmetric amplifier (output impedance 50 Ω).

This treatment resulted in amplitude deviations ≤ 5% over an experimental session of up to 2 h. If electrodes were not used for DC measurements, but for NLDS, they were additionally coated with a thin polymer film in order to improve noise reduction and stability [ 24 ].et al.et al.Measurement techniques The cuvettes could be charged with the test solutions, discharged and rinsed through the teflon hoses by a syringe. A sample volume of 1 ml was used. Device specific, systematic errors were routinely checked by exchanging the electrode arrays used for sample and reference measurements and testing several cuvettes of the same type. After loading they were flooded with Argon for about 10 min. in order to remove O 2  from the solutions, avoid oxidation reactions and subsequent arising of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the solute, then the hoses were sealed with rubber caps. After reaching a stable temperature of 20 ± 0.2°C, measurements were started. First 10 \"dummy\" scans were performed, in order to obtain a dynamic equilibration of the electrodes.  B dc  = 40 μT was selected as static magnetic field component for the ICR condition, because it is of comparable intensity as the natural geomagnetic field of the earth. A new sample was used for every experiment, an \"aging effect\" of the test solutions was observed, similar to an earlier seen effect, which resulted in a decreasing reproducibility for experiments with magnetic field exposed lipid vesicles [ 27 ]. Three types of techniques for measuring the electric currents in the solutions were applied, always using the gold electrode array described above: 1) For the validation of the ICR parameters of the Glu-HCl solution, the experiment of Zhadin  et al.  [ 25 ] was repeated. The DC voltage of 80 mV was applied to the outer electrodes (+40 mV and -40 mV), and the current through the solution was calculated from the resulting voltage between the inner electrodes. The current calibration was earlier performed with 10 mM HCl and the Glu-HCl solution. By that way, used by many established voltammetric techniques [ 29 ], superimposing electrode transition potentials can be widely avoided, in contrary to a direct current measurement with a two electrode system. A constant magnetic field  B dc  = 40 μT or 50 μT and a frequency sweep of the alternating magnetic field  B ac  = 50 nT (parallel to  B dc ) from 2 to 7 Hz with 0.025 Hz/s and a resolution of 0.05 Hz were used. 2) For the investigation of the ICR transition with NLDS the same magnetic field setup is used like described under 1), the NLDS sine wave was applied on the electrodes (instead of the DC-voltage) and a constant magnetic field  B dc  = 40 μT was used. 3) Finally the FRV setup allowed the frequency analysis of the electric signals with variable amplitudes using the DNLDS technique described above. Glu-HCl samples were exposed to constant ICR conditions ( B dc  = 40 μT and  B ac  = 50 nT, 4.14 Hz fixed), for reference experiments only the static component ( B dc  = 40 μT) was applied with  B dc  switched off. The amplitude of the sinusoidal scanning voltage was increased in each experiment from 100–1100 mV in steps of 10 mV, record by record, the duration of each cycle was 4 s. The two data sets (from Glu-HCl and HCl sample) yielded by every single record were seperately Fourier transformed in order to get the spectra, these two spectra were divided by themselves (Glu-HCL spectrum by HCl spectrum) and the ratio spectrum was subsequently attached to a data file on a harddisc for later evaluation.\\nMeasurement techniques\\nThe cuvettes could be charged with the test solutions, discharged and rinsed through the teflon hoses by a syringe.

The peak current is about 20% larger than the mean ionic current of 7.4 nA, the peak width at half-height is 0.3 Hz (Figure  3 ). Equation (1) was validated by repeating the experiment ten times at an altered static magnetic field strenght of  B dc  = 50 μT. The current peak shifted to 5.2 ± 0.05 Hz with a height of 9.08 ± 0.3 nA, which lies approximately 22% over the mean ionic background current. These data verify the results of Zhadin  et al.  [ 25 ], and the field-dependence is in agreement with Eqn. 1. The signal was observed over a concentration of 2–10 mM. The signal became too small at c Glu  < 2 mM, and there was insufficient solubility c Glu  >10 mM (at 20°C). Subsequently, the pH-dependence was determined under identical magnetic field and scanning conditions mentioned above. Resonance effects are only seen in a narrow pH range of Glu-HCl (pH 2.75 – 2.90), with an maximum at 2.85, and vanishes outside this range. Figure 3 Current increase at ICR (DC).  Current increase through the glutamic acid /HCl solution (2.24 mM, pH = 2.85) at and near ICR conditions. The static magnetic field strength is  B dc  = 40 μT, the amplitude of the alternating field  B ac  is 50 nT, the frequency resolution Δf = 0.05 Hz. Course using a constant electrode voltage of 80 mV (\"Zhadin\\'s experiment\"). After this verification of the experiment of Zhadin  et al.  [ 25 ], these electric measurements were accompanied by some UV-VIS light scattering investigations, which should give information about possible colloidal properties of the sample. Glu-HCl solutions were investigated at a wavelength of λ = 260 nm with the pH adjusted from pH 2.55 to 3.25, showing a significant scattering maximum around pH 2.8 (data not shown). Further some DC voltage scans were performed with the gold electrode array for Glu at pH 2.85, and for dilute HCl adjusted to pH 2.85, applying only a static magnetic field  B dc  = 40 μT (no  B ac ). A voltage range of 100–1000 mV was selected to allow a comparison with the voltammetric information out of the frequency resolved voltammetry (FRV). Again, maxima of conductivity were obtained, they lie at 250 ± 10 mV for Glu-HCl and 280 ± 10 mV for water/HCl pH 2.85 (data not shown). NLDS spectroscopy Next, the solutions were investigated by NLDS spectroscopy, in order to investigate in which way the frequency composition of the current spectra will change, when the predicted ICR condition for Glu-HCl is matched ( B dc  = 40 μT and a  B ac  with  f  = 4.15 Hz). 15 experiments were performed and averaged. Figure  4  shows the power of the 2 nd  harmonic (referenced against dilute HCl, pH 2.85). The full dataset is shown in Figure  5  on an absolute current scale, for magnetic frequencies of 4.00–4.30 Hz in a 3d-representation. The 1 st  harmonic is split up into 2 closely spaced peaks around the ICR frequency. This is also well seen in Figure  4 , an effect not seen in the \"Zhadin\\'s\" DC experiments [ 25 ] without frequency resolution. Furthermore an increase of the 2–6 harmonics is seen in Figure  5  for 4.10 and 4.20 Hz magnetic frequency, closely flanking the ICR value. The average standard deviation of these experiments was 8.2 % of the average Power of all DNLDS spectra. Figure 4 Current increase at ICR (AC).  Course of the 2 nd  harmonics of NLDS spectra taken for every scanned frequency of  B ac . Data were related to reference scans with  B dc  = 40 μT, but without  B ac . The grey bars indicate standard deviations. Other conditions like Figure 2. Figure 5 NLDS spectra on ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) transition.  3D-representation of the NLDS resolved current through a glutamic acid / HCl solution (2.24 mM, pH 2.85) during transition of the ICR condition (static magnetic field  B dc  = 40 μT, alternating field  B ac  = 50 nT, f BAC  = 4.14 Hz) in steps of 0.05 Hz. Kinetics The following kinetic experiment should clarify, in which way the conductivity of the Glu solution is affected by repeated transitions through the ICR conditions. 12 experiments were performed, each with a new Glu-HCl sample. 100 DNLDS spectra were recorded with single 2 Hz sinus signals with 100 mV amplitude.  B dc  = 40 μT was permanently applied in all experiments, while  B ac  with  f  = 4.15 Hz was applied only during measurement no. 20–39 and 60–79. Subsequently, the courses of the lowest 5 harmonics (for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 Hz) were normalized to ± 1, and all 12 experiments were averaged, Figure  6  therefore represents the kinetics averaged over a total of 60 datasets. Because of the standardization, data are scaled in arbitrary units (a.u.). The power difference between \"on\" (exposure) and \"off\" periods is 1.38 ± 0.34 dB, standard deviations are drawn as bars. Figure 6 Current kinetics of switched ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) condition.  Kinetics in arbitrary units (a.u.) of the ICR condition to a glutamic acid / HCl solution (2.24 mM, pH 2.85). The static magnetic field  B dc  (40 μT) was applied permanently, the alternating field  B ac  (50 nT, 4.14 Hz) was applied as indicated by \"on\" and \"off\". One experiment consists of a set of 101 DNLDS spectra performed by a 2 Hz sinus signal with 100 mV Amplitude. The data first 5 harmonics (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 Hz) where normalized and then averaged. Data are calculated out of 12 independent experiments. The grey lines mark the standard deviations, the dotted straight line shows the linear regression of the negative drift, represented by the equation  y = -0.0039t + 0.5015 . Changes of the signal intensity become obvious, when switching the alternating magnetic field on or off. Over the entire experiment there seems to be a constant drift which we take as an indication for irreversible processes. This drift is indicated by the dotted line, which results from a linear regression of the entire dataset (-0.0039 t  + 0.5015). The course seems to reach a new steady value after on/off switching of the alternating magnetic field with a time delay, which seems larger, when ICR is switched off. The average current change after the switching processes is -0.2 nA/s, the negative values result from comparison with a reference. Differential NLDS experiments with variable control voltages (FRV) Finally, the FVR method should show the intensity distributions of the harmonics of the DNLDS spectra and their dependence from the used amplitude of the electrode input voltage. Again Glu-at pH = 2.85 was investigated, using diluted HCl (pH 2.85) as the reference. The ratio of the resulting two NLDS power spectra was calculated according to equation (2), resulting in a logarithmic DNLDS spectrum. 101 such scans (4 s each) were performed for every single experiment, during which the amplitude of the applied course of 4 periods of a 2 Hz sine voltage increased from 100 to 1100 mV in 10 mV steps. Corresponding datapoints of the successive single DNLDS spectra generated one AC voltammogram each, for the respective frequency. Altogether, a set of 201 frequency resolved voltamogramms was obtained, because every spectrum contains 201 data values. Subsequently 20 such experiments were performed in which the solution was exposed to ICR conditions, alternating with 20 experiments, were only the static field was applied ( B dc  = 40 μT), but not  B ac . Each of the two groups of experiments were averaged separately. Then the two resulting datasets were subtracted (ICR experimental data minus data of the experiments with ICR condition switched off). This differential dataset had a total amplitude of 2.03 ± 0.38 dB, presenting just the contribution of Glu, because the voltammetric background from HCl was subtracted. Subsequent data normalization should allow a better comparison of spectra recorded with different amplitudes and likewise of voltammograms at different frequencies. Therefore in Figures  7 ,  8  the full dataset is shown, again after standardization in a range from – 1 to 1. Figure  7  presents the data with standardization on the voltage axis for the voltammograms belonging to the individual frequencies. Figure  8  contains the same dataset, but with standardized spectra. The intensity maximum shifts with rising frequency from approx. 250 mV to 500 mV for frequencies <40 Hz, it then remains constant around 500–700 mV for higher frequencies. So most information will be contained in the low harmonic orders. Figure  9  shows the voltage dependent behaviour at the NLDS fundamental frequency (2 Hz) and three harmonics in the lower range (4, 8, and 12 Hz). Broad maxima are obvious, which seem to shift to higher voltages with increasing harmonic order by about 60 mV/Hz. The intensities increase to a local maximum at approx.25 Hz. At higher frequencies, the amplitude effects caused by the exposure to ICR conditions have a local maximum at 480 mV and merge into a continuum beyond 750 mV for all higher frequencies, according to the predominating capacitive damping of aqueous solutions with rising frequency. Figure 7 DNLDS resolved voltammogram dataset (normalized to spectral axis): Normalizations of the DNLDS resolved voltammogram dataset (sinewave 2 Hz with amplitude rising from 100–1100 mV, details of gaining data see text) of a Glutamic acid / HCl solution (2.24 mM, pH 2.85) under ICR Conditions (B dc  = 40 μT, B ac  = 50 nT, 4.14 Hz). Datapoints are colored resp. shaded according to the scale on the right border. Normalization of the spectra for each Amplitude shows a rising proportion of higher frequencies with a local (at about 500 mV) and a total maximum (at about 700–800 mV). By contrast, the proportions of the base frequency (2 Hz) and the lower harmonics decline. Figure 8 DNLDS resolved voltammogram dataset (normalized to voltage axis): The same dataset and representation style like Figure 9, but with normalization of the single voltammograms for each frequency. For low frequencies (<5 Hz) Voltammograms have a maximum at about 250 mV, comparable to the pure DC volt scans. But with rising spectral harmonics voltammetric maxima occur at about 700 mV with overlaying intensity patterns of 4 and 16 Hz in distance. Worthy of remark are 62, 78 and 94 Hz, these all are four folds of the used base ICR resonance frequency 4.14 Hz. Figure 9 Extracted voltage courses of the DNLDS resolved voltammogram dataset.

Figure 5 NLDS spectra on ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) transition.  3D-representation of the NLDS resolved current through a glutamic acid / HCl solution (2.24 mM, pH 2.85) during transition of the ICR condition (static magnetic field  B dc  = 40 μT, alternating field  B ac  = 50 nT, f BAC  = 4.14 Hz) in steps of 0.05 Hz.\\nNLDS spectroscopy\\nNext, the solutions were investigated by NLDS spectroscopy, in order to investigate in which way the frequency composition of the current spectra will change, when the predicted ICR condition for Glu-HCl is matched ( B dc  = 40 μT and a  B ac  with  f  = 4.15 Hz). 15 experiments were performed and averaged. Figure  4  shows the power of the 2 nd  harmonic (referenced against dilute HCl, pH 2.85). The full dataset is shown in Figure  5  on an absolute current scale, for magnetic frequencies of 4.00–4.30 Hz in a 3d-representation. The 1 st  harmonic is split up into 2 closely spaced peaks around the ICR frequency. This is also well seen in Figure  4 , an effect not seen in the \"Zhadin\\'s\" DC experiments [ 25 ] without frequency resolution. Furthermore an increase of the 2–6 harmonics is seen in Figure  5  for 4.10 and 4.20 Hz magnetic frequency, closely flanking the ICR value. The average standard deviation of these experiments was 8.2 % of the average Power of all DNLDS spectra.B dcB acfKinetics The following kinetic experiment should clarify, in which way the conductivity of the Glu solution is affected by repeated transitions through the ICR conditions. 12 experiments were performed, each with a new Glu-HCl sample. 100 DNLDS spectra were recorded with single 2 Hz sinus signals with 100 mV amplitude.  B dc  = 40 μT was permanently applied in all experiments, while  B ac  with  f  = 4.15 Hz was applied only during measurement no. 20–39 and 60–79. Subsequently, the courses of the lowest 5 harmonics (for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 Hz) were normalized to ± 1, and all 12 experiments were averaged, Figure  6  therefore represents the kinetics averaged over a total of 60 datasets. Because of the standardization, data are scaled in arbitrary units (a.u.). The power difference between \"on\" (exposure) and \"off\" periods is 1.38 ± 0.34 dB, standard deviations are drawn as bars. Figure 6 Current kinetics of switched ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) condition.  Kinetics in arbitrary units (a.u.) of the ICR condition to a glutamic acid / HCl solution (2.24 mM, pH 2.85). The static magnetic field  B dc  (40 μT) was applied permanently, the alternating field  B ac  (50 nT, 4.14 Hz) was applied as indicated by \"on\" and \"off\". One experiment consists of a set of 101 DNLDS spectra performed by a 2 Hz sinus signal with 100 mV Amplitude. The data first 5 harmonics (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 Hz) where normalized and then averaged. Data are calculated out of 12 independent experiments. The grey lines mark the standard deviations, the dotted straight line shows the linear regression of the negative drift, represented by the equation  y = -0.0039t + 0.5015 . Changes of the signal intensity become obvious, when switching the alternating magnetic field on or off. Over the entire experiment there seems to be a constant drift which we take as an indication for irreversible processes. This drift is indicated by the dotted line, which results from a linear regression of the entire dataset (-0.0039 t  + 0.5015). The course seems to reach a new steady value after on/off switching of the alternating magnetic field with a time delay, which seems larger, when ICR is switched off. The average current change after the switching processes is -0.2 nA/s, the negative values result from comparison with a reference.\\nKinetics\\nThe following kinetic experiment should clarify, in which way the conductivity of the Glu solution is affected by repeated transitions through the ICR conditions. 12 experiments were performed, each with a new Glu-HCl sample.100 DNLDS spectra were recorded with single 2 Hz sinus signals with 100 mV amplitude.

Again Glu-at pH = 2.85 was investigated, using diluted HCl (pH 2.85) as the reference. The ratio of the resulting two NLDS power spectra was calculated according to equation (2), resulting in a logarithmic DNLDS spectrum. 101 such scans (4 s each) were performed for every single experiment, during which the amplitude of the applied course of 4 periods of a 2 Hz sine voltage increased from 100 to 1100 mV in 10 mV steps. Corresponding datapoints of the successive single DNLDS spectra generated one AC voltammogram each, for the respective frequency. Altogether, a set of 201 frequency resolved voltamogramms was obtained, because every spectrum contains 201 data values. Subsequently 20 such experiments were performed in which the solution was exposed to ICR conditions, alternating with 20 experiments, were only the static field was applied ( B dc  = 40 μT), but not  B ac . Each of the two groups of experiments were averaged separately. Then the two resulting datasets were subtracted (ICR experimental data minus data of the experiments with ICR condition switched off). This differential dataset had a total amplitude of 2.03 ± 0.38 dB, presenting just the contribution of Glu, because the voltammetric background from HCl was subtracted. Subsequent data normalization should allow a better comparison of spectra recorded with different amplitudes and likewise of voltammograms at different frequencies. Therefore in Figures  7 ,  8  the full dataset is shown, again after standardization in a range from – 1 to 1. Figure  7  presents the data with standardization on the voltage axis for the voltammograms belonging to the individual frequencies. Figure  8  contains the same dataset, but with standardized spectra. The intensity maximum shifts with rising frequency from approx. 250 mV to 500 mV for frequencies <40 Hz, it then remains constant around 500–700 mV for higher frequencies. So most information will be contained in the low harmonic orders. Figure  9  shows the voltage dependent behaviour at the NLDS fundamental frequency (2 Hz) and three harmonics in the lower range (4, 8, and 12 Hz). Broad maxima are obvious, which seem to shift to higher voltages with increasing harmonic order by about 60 mV/Hz. The intensities increase to a local maximum at approx.25 Hz. At higher frequencies, the amplitude effects caused by the exposure to ICR conditions have a local maximum at 480 mV and merge into a continuum beyond 750 mV for all higher frequencies, according to the predominating capacitive damping of aqueous solutions with rising frequency. Figure 7 DNLDS resolved voltammogram dataset (normalized to spectral axis): Normalizations of the DNLDS resolved voltammogram dataset (sinewave 2 Hz with amplitude rising from 100–1100 mV, details of gaining data see text) of a Glutamic acid / HCl solution (2.24 mM, pH 2.85) under ICR Conditions (B dc  = 40 μT, B ac  = 50 nT, 4.14 Hz). Datapoints are colored resp. shaded according to the scale on the right border. Normalization of the spectra for each Amplitude shows a rising proportion of higher frequencies with a local (at about 500 mV) and a total maximum (at about 700–800 mV). By contrast, the proportions of the base frequency (2 Hz) and the lower harmonics decline. Figure 8 DNLDS resolved voltammogram dataset (normalized to voltage axis): The same dataset and representation style like Figure 9, but with normalization of the single voltammograms for each frequency. For low frequencies (<5 Hz) Voltammograms have a maximum at about 250 mV, comparable to the pure DC volt scans. But with rising spectral harmonics voltammetric maxima occur at about 700 mV with overlaying intensity patterns of 4 and 16 Hz in distance. Worthy of remark are 62, 78 and 94 Hz, these all are four folds of the used base ICR resonance frequency 4.14 Hz. Figure 9 Extracted voltage courses of the DNLDS resolved voltammogram dataset.  Voltammograms for some harmonics of the DNLDS resolved voltammogram dataset (sine wave 2 Hz with variable amplitude 100–1100 mV, not normalized here, see text for details) of a glutamic acid / HCl solution (2.24 mM, pH 2.85) under ICR Conditions (B dc  = 40 μT, B ac  = 50 nT, 4.14 Hz).\\nDifferential NLDS experiments with variable control voltages (FRV)\\nFinally, the FVR method should show the intensity distributions of the harmonics of the DNLDS spectra and their dependence from the used amplitude of the electrode input voltage.

The effect shows no linear dependency of magnetic field parameters, it is rather peaking in a narrow range of combinations of static magnetic field strengths and frequencies of additional alternating magnetic fields, described by Eqn. 1. Several precautions were applied, in order to avoid artefacts as best as possible. So it has been shown, that the signal to noise ratio will be improved significantly by clamping the voltage drop inside the electrolyte and, if needed, by a subsequent calculation of the current by calibration functions, instead of a direct current measurement. These techniques are wide spread in voltammetry [ 26 ] and obligatory in NLDS [ 23 ]. Because the voltage clamping ideally should work without any electric current flow, the electrode surface transition potentials could more likely be excluded for causing the observed EMF effect (\"electrode effects\"). It should be least then apply, if a cell voltage is used bellow the electrochemical potentials of the electrode-electrolyte system, and independent from the other experimental setup. Different explanations are recently discussed for the kind of EMF effect observed here, all of them suppose a non linear oscillator principle described by quantum mechanical terms, allowing energetic interactions with the environment far below the thermal equilibrium of life processes. This search for \"wave functions fitting in a properly sized box\" should consequently provide an explanation for the repeatedly observed effects of effectiveness windows, regarding specific field strengths and frequencies of the EMF, e.g. seen on green algae grown in a magnetic gradient [ 30 ]. Ion channels of biological membranes were proposed in a early work of Liboff [ 31 ] for a suitable environment supporting ICR. A model of Binhi  et al.  [ 14 , 32 ] is based on an interference mechanism of quantum states of ions within protein cavities. The quantum dynamic description of an ion is given for the case of ion-protein complexes that rotate in magnetic fields. The individual molecular rotation is taken into account. The spatial distances considered here are in the size of the molecules involved, cavities built by proteins, and their bond lengths. A quantum electrodynamic description needing no additional supporting structures like protein molecules or lipid membranes was worked out by Giudice  et al.  [ 33 ], as an attempt to explain the experimental results of Zhadin  et al.  [ 25 ]. It is based on an underlying two-phase domain model of the solvent water, in which at room temperature ~40% of its volume is organized in spheres with a diameter of approximately 100 nm providing coherence for the included water molecules. These spheres should establish a stable frontier region with a thickness of ~4 nm, which allows a undisturbed ion movement, separated by an energy gap 0.26 eV against the surrounding, non coherent water phase. The circulation frequency of the ions in the frontier region should be given by equation (1) and be dependent on the external magnetic field strength. An additional superimposed alternating field  B ac  with the same frequency will modulate the radii of the orbits. As a consequence, the ion orbits fit no longer the frontier region and the ions escape into the surrounding water phase, where they increase the conductance. This model also tries to describe the results of [ 25 ] quantitatively, but takes therefore in account the electrode geometry of the original experiment. Further attention should turned to the comparably long persistence time of the ICR state (see Figure  6 ) implying a comparable long lifetime. Considering the existence of supramolecular orders of liquid water, such long lifetimes (>10 s up to hours) have been predicted for these states sensitive to weak EMF at biologically relevant temperatures. Ponomarev  et al.  [ 34 ] propose linearly ordered chains and clusters like a liquid crystal phase in water which interact with EMF. The soliton theory was applied for description. Studies on the electromagnetic \"memory effect\" of water implicate even high sensitivity and long lifetimes [ 35 ], and are probably caused by the same mechanism as the effects observed here. An more hypothetical two phase model also providing boundary layers has been emphasized by Colic  et al.  [ 36 ]. The authors discuss the presence of micro-dispersed gas bubbles. But this possibly can be discarded more than likely in our experiments, because degassed solutions were used throughout. Special attention deserve the obvious frequency dependent amplitude windows of the dielectric currents, which are observed in the NLDS experiments (FRV) with variable amplitudes. Two explanations for this effect would be possible. The additional electric field caused by the AC signal of the NLDS could modulate the charged particles inside a \"quantum box\", whatever will be the reason for its existence. An indication for such a mechanism could be the more or less ordered local maxima of conductivity in spectral as well as in the voltammetric domain of the data. But the frequency dependent conductivity band shifts of the FRV experiments (Figure  9 ) could either result from a \"simple\" interference with the frequency of the  B ac  field, which can be tuned on its part in discrete multiples, corresponding to possible \"overtones\" of the ICR (orbital) frequency of the ions. Interactions of the internal electric and external magnetic field could probably cause side band modulations. They are probably responsible for the seen splitting up of the ICR resonance peak (figure  4 ) when using a AC instead of a DC probe voltage. For progressed investigation of the observed effects some additional properties of the electric charge environment of the Glu ion should be known. The isoelectric point of Glu is at pH 3.22, the pK of the α-COOH-group is 2.19, that of the β-COOH at 4.25, the small optimum for the EMF effect around pH 2.85 does not coincide with any of these points. The Debye-Hueckel radii for Glu are about 5 nm, they determine the free ion movement, and influence consequently the current. Moreover, they could be responsible for a proper fit of the spatial ion distribution to the environing structure whatever, which enables a resonant EMF effect.\\nDiscussion\\nAll results suggest the existence of a sensitive magnetic field effect on the conductance of a aqueous Glu solution.

In this work, the electric currents in a glutamic acid solution were investigated with frequency resolution after applying weak EMF. The resonance peaks and the overtone-analysis in response to weak static plus alternating EMF support the existence of the ICR phenomenon in aqueous solutions containing electrolytes. A analysis of the data is possible under the basic assumption of a far reaching principle of arrangement (realized e.g. by the solvent matrix), which allows quantum electrodynamic processes on the nano-physical scale or larger. In general any kind of a suitable coherence mechanism should be essential for the observed effects in a dense medium like water, which had to support an energy gap against the thermal fluctuations of the environment, and enable a movement of charged particles which are only magnetically coupled to their outer environment. Not at least, the high sensitivity of the ICR to weak electromagnetic fields should be regarded. It makes the modulation of biological processes by the weak EMF of our everyday environment conceivable [ 37 ], possibly inducing likewise health risks and chances for new therapies, hardly minded till this day. Especially concerning the earlier [ 25 ] and the present study, glutamate is a neurotransmitter and is involved in a couple of other biological processes. The geomagnetic field, with all its anomalies and regional differences [ 38 ], in combination with all the natural and civilizing EMF, overlap with a wide range of possible ICR of biologically relevant ions. But also technical applications basing on the ICR are imaginable, as a potential direction of future research. Its further investigation will be worthwhile, by new experiments, comparing field studies of health phenomena, and not at least a further clear up of its physical principle.\\nConclusion\\nThe results strengthen the idea, that weak electromagnetic fields can cause an resonance effect on molecular or even supramolecular scale in electrolyte solutions [ 33 , 35 ], and thereby possibly, influence biological processes, which involve these electrolytes.

In this process, new bone named \"osteoma\" forms in extraskeletal areas which in normal condition do not ossify. NPOA were first described by Dejerine and Cellier [ 3 ] from observations of medullary wounded soldiers. They proposed the term NPOA, though other terms are used, such as: neurogenic osteoma, ossifying myositis in paraplegic, ectopic ossification, heterotopic ossification, etc. NPOAs have also been described as complications of many systemic diseases [ 4 ], acute pancreatitis, toxic syndromes and others [ 5 ]. The first clinical manifestations are local inflammatory signs, tumefaction and progressively limited range of motion of the involved joint region. Those appear between the second and tenth weeks after the onset of the pathological condition [ 6 ]. Despite anti-inflammatories treatment to prevent NPOA [ 7 ], excision of the newly formed bone called \"osteoma\", is the only known therapy. As shown by radiographic and scintigraphic observations, heterotopic bone formation evolves from an early appearance of soft tissue densification and attenuation of the muscle signal to a mineral signal [ 8 ]. After 6 months, osteoma rarely increases in amount, but some further maturation occurs. As an assumption based on the fading of technetium fixation, the lesion is supposed to be mature after 1 to 1.5 years [ 9 , 10 ]. Hence, the process of NPOA formation seems to be frozen at the time of osteoma mineralization. Very little is known about the pathophysiology of NPOA formation. Assuming such a freezing of the process of NPOA formation and an involvement of the periosteoma tissues in the reported relapses following surgery, we postulated that the periosteoma soft tissues could show some of the very early stages of the NPOA formation. We performed histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical studies of soft tissues dissected from the periphery of osteomas. We used samples of varying age lesions and searched for the main osteogenic and chondrogenic markers: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, type I collagen and osteocalcin (OCN) for the bone [ 11 - 13 ], and type II collagen, sulfated and acid glycosaminoglycans, type X collagen and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) for the cartilage [ 14 ]. In the light of our results, we propose a model of NPOA formation.\\nBackground\\nNeurogenic Para Osteo-Arthropathies (NPOA) occurs in patients with brain or spinal cord injury, hemiplegias, various encephalopathies, tetanus [ 1 ] or neurological disregulation [ 2 ]. In this process, new bone named \"osteoma\" forms in extraskeletal areas which in normal condition do not ossify. NPOA were first described by Dejerine and Cellier [ 3 ] from observations of medullary wounded soldiers. They proposed the term NPOA, though other terms are used, such as: neurogenic osteoma, ossifying myositis in paraplegic, ectopic ossification, heterotopic ossification, etc. NPOAs have also been described as complications of many systemic diseases [ 4 ], acute pancreatitis, toxic syndromes and others [ 5 ].The first clinical manifestations are local inflammatory signs, tumefaction and progressively limited range of motion of the involved joint region. Those appear between the second and tenth weeks after the onset of the pathological condition [ 6 ]. Despite anti-inflammatories treatment to prevent NPOA [ 7 ], excision of the newly formed bone called \"osteoma\", is the only known therapy.As shown by radiographic and scintigraphic observations, heterotopic bone formation evolves from an early appearance of soft tissue densification and attenuation of the muscle signal to a mineral signal [ 8 ]. After 6 months, osteoma rarely increases in amount, but some further maturation occurs. As an assumption based on the fading of technetium fixation, the lesion is supposed to be mature after 1 to 1.5 years [ 9 , 10 ]. Hence, the process of NPOA formation seems to be frozen at the time of osteoma mineralization.Very little is known about the pathophysiology of NPOA formation. Assuming such a freezing of the process of NPOA formation and an involvement of the periosteoma tissues in the reported relapses following surgery, we postulated that the periosteoma soft tissues could show some of the very early stages of the NPOA formation. We performed histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical studies of soft tissues dissected from the periphery of osteomas. We used samples of varying age lesions and searched for the main osteogenic and chondrogenic markers: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, type I collagen and osteocalcin (OCN) for the bone [ 11 - 13 ], and type II collagen, sulfated and acid glycosaminoglycans, type X collagen and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) for the cartilage [ 14 ]. In the light of our results, we propose a model of NPOA formation.Methods a)Specimen processing and histochemicals The 28 specimens were obtained from 27 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery for osteoma excision. NPOA\\'s were localized on: elbows (7), hips (18) and knees (3). The time from the neurologic insult ranged from 5 months to 216 months. The initial conditions were: 11 Brain Injuries (BI), 3 Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), 1 BI plus SCI, 4 strokes, and 9 patients sustained coma of various etiology (legionellose, anoxia, toxic condition, pneumonia, suicide attempt using neuroplegic). Specimens obtained during the course of surgery, referred to in this paper as \"osteoma\", were immediately placed in sterile Gibco Hanks\\' balanced salts solution (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) at 4°C for transportation. The soft connective tissue was easily dissected off from the osteoma in order to exclude any part of the bony mass (Fig  1 ). The specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) with 0.5 M sucrose, frozen in isopentane in liquid nitrogen and stored at -86°C until embedding in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakuran Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands). Cryosectioning was performed on a Leica CM 3050 S cryostat (Leica Micro-Systems, Reil-Malmaison, France) at a thickness of 7 μm. Histochemical staining was performed according to standard protocols: Erlich\\'s hematoxylin-eosin for general topographic staining, alcian blue pH1 for sulfated acid glycosaminoglycans, Von Kossa to show calcified areas, Oil red O to identify lipids, and Van Gieson Picro-Fuchsine for collagen distribution. The ALP-activity was demonstrated by using the Sigma procedure n°86 (Sigma Diagnostics, Saint Quentin Fallier, France). Slides were examined on a Leica DMR microscope (Leica Micro-Systems, Reuil-Malmaison, France), and pictures were recorded using a CCD colour camera with the Q Fluoro and Lida software systems (Leica Micro-Systems, Reil-Malmaison, France). Figure 1 Dissection of part of the soft tissue surrounding a piece of osteoma. b)Immunohistochemistry The anti-human monoclonal mouse antibodies against type II collagen (NeoMarkers Inc., CA, USA), OCN (Interchim, Montlucon, France), anti-human polyclonal goat antibody against type I collagen (Santacruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), anti-rat polyclonal rabbit antibody against type X collagen (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, CA, USA) and anti-human polyclonal rabbit antibody against VEGF (Santacruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) were used at 1 mg/ml. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse was purchased from Immunovision Technologies (CA, USA), peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit from Dako (Dako Corporation, CA, USA) and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat from Santacruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). They were used at a 1/20, 1/50 and 1/100 dilution, respectively. Frozen sections post-fixed with acetone were treated with hyaluronidase (5 mg/ml in Tris Buffered Saline) one hour at 37°C. For type X collagen immunostaining slides were treated first 15 minutes at 37°C with hyaluronidase (5 mg/ml in PBS), washed two times in PBS, then 15 minutes with chondroitinase (2 U/ml in PBS), and washed two times in PBS. Immunohistochemistry was performed using ABC method. Briefly, endogenous peroxydase activity was eliminated with 0.3% H 2 O 2  until total clearing of oxygen bubbles. Non-specific protein binding was performed with 10% non-immune serum, same host as secondary antibody, in PBS with 1% Bovin Serum Albumin (Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature, or 24 hours at 4°C with anti-type I collagen. Excess antibody was removed by washing the sections with PBS. Sections were incubated 1 hour with horseradish peroxydase-labeled secondary antibody diluted in PBS. 3-3\\'diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution (Dako Corporation, CA, USA) was then added in order to obtain staining. Sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin-eosin or nuclear red/eosin, dehydrated, and mounted with Mountex medium (Microm, France). Controls were systematically performed omitting the primary antibody. Slides were examined by light microscopy using a Leica DMR microscope (Leica Micro-Systems, Reil-Malmaison, France). c)Ultrasound (US) Examination Most of the patients were referred to Raymond Poincaré teaching hospital, at the time of surgery. US examination was performed when NPOA was clinically suspected in five patients whose rehabilitation has begun. Five hips were explored by US in two BI and three SCI. Linear 8 to 15 MHz and sectorial 4 MHz transducers (Sequoia Acuson-Siemens Erlangen) were used. A sectorial low frequency transducer was used because in the hip area NPOA can be very large and very deep especially in the gluteus area compared to the subcutaneous plane. US examination was combined with color and energy Doppler. In all cases a plain film was obtained the same day as the US examination.\\nMethods\\na)Specimen processing and histochemicals The 28 specimens were obtained from 27 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery for osteoma excision.

Several kinds of tissues appeared on the slides so the diversity of these figures deserves a systematic analysis which will be completed in the next sections. Briefly, the ground basis of our preparations was a more or less fibro-cellular connective tissue displaying sometimes edema and/or necrosis. Suffering and degenerating tissues with vacuolized myofibers, thrombotic vessels and adipose tissue were often observed (Fig  2a ). Muscular tissue underwent degeneration as shown by the vacuolisation or the disappearance of the internal eosinophily. Oil red-O stained adipocytes in the vicinity of some degenerating muscle with hyperplastic endomysium and perimysium (Fig  2b ). In these regions, ALP activity was detected in the endomysium and perimysium cells of degenerated muscles (Fig  2b , inset). Figure 2 a: Frozen section of soft tissue from a 72 months hip NPOA : Hematoxylin eosin (h&e): Thrombotic vessels (V), more or less advanced vacuolization/degeneration of muscular fibers (M), and adipous tissue (A).  b:  Oil Red-O staining : Degenerated muscle fibers (M) stained by eosin were embedded in a strongly hyperplastic perimysium. This structure was itself located inside an adipous tissue whose appearance and compartmentalization by endomysium-like sheets of cell layers suggests a muscular origin. Inset: ALP activity: the same area showed an intense ALP activity in some cells in hyperplastic perimysium.  c:  Hematoxylin eosin (h&e) staining showed hyperplastic intima and media. Morphologically normal vessels were rarely observed and winding of the vasculature was an almost constant finding. Many of the vessels were thrombotic, sometimes with hyperplastic intimae or media (Fig  2c ). Some perivascular cells showed ALP activity and seemed to migrate out from these proliferating zones (Fig  3 ). Clustered or isolated round cells with high ALP activity were also observed embedded in a high amount of collagen matrix (Fig  3 , inset). Figure 3 Frozen sections of soft tissue of an 8 months hip NPOA : Blue Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity counter stained with nuclear red-eosin: perivascular cells show high ALP activity near by vessels (V) and some of these seems to migrate from these areas. Inset: Cluster and isolated rounded cells (C) with high ALP showed a more advanced stage of differentiation. These findings point to a chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation of formerly undifferentiated mesenchymal cells from the stroma and the vessel walls. More advanced stages of cartilaginous differentiation were frequently observed in avascular areas with varying degrees of chondrocyte maturation. Morphologically recognizable columns of chondrocyte-like cells presenting a high ALP activity were observed. Moreover, we could observe all the stages of progressive chondrocyte differentiation from quiescence to chondrocyte hypertrophy/matrix mineralization and endochondral ossification (Fig  4 ). Figure 4 Frozen section of soft tissue of an 8 months hip NPOA : Blue Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity counter stained with nuclear red-eosin: The successive stage of chondrocytes differentiation were observed: quiescent (Q), proliferative (P), prehypertrophic (D), hypertrophic (H) and mineralization zones. Inset: Lamellar bone deposition (L) is visualized with polarized light. A high ALP activity was also found in cells surrounding the cartilage areas undergoing mineralization and embedded in a slight envelope of woven bone with ALP positive cells (Fig  5a ). On the other hand, ALP activity of hypertrophic chondrocytes was progressively lost as mineralization occurred, thus Von Kossa staining seemed to be a negative image of ALP activity (Fig  5b ). Figure 5 Frozen sections of soft tissue of a 5 months elbow NPOA :  a:  Blue Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity counter stained by nuclear red-eosin: A very strong ALP activity in multilayered cells surrounded a peripherically mineralized area. This area was made of woven bone (W) deposed on an hypertrophic cartilage (H) centered by prehypertrophic chondrocytes. Hypertrophic and prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the non-mineralized matrix displayed ALP activity.  b:  Vonkossa staining of a next section counter stained by h&e: Von Kossa stain was a negative image of the ALP activity. Osteoid matrix was deposed upon the calcified cartilage matrix and underwent mineralization. Palissade-arranged cells lined this osteoid and displayed morphological image of osteoblast-like cells (OB).  c:  Oscteocalcin immunolabelling of a next section of the same specimen counter stained by h&e: Osteocalcin immunoreactivity in the eosinophilic osteoid at the border of the mineralized woven bone and sligtly on osteoblast-like cells (OB) lining this zone. Slight labelling was also present in the woven bone (W), but not in the cartilage (C) areas.  d:  Type X collagen immunolabelling of a next section of the same specimen counter stained by h&e: Type X collagen immunoreactivity was found in the mineralized cartilage area up to the woven bone. It also streched over most of the fibrous tissue (F) surrounding the mineralized area. Inset: It was also present in hypertrophic chondrocytes and their matrix.  e:  Type II collagen immunolabelling of this specimen conter stain by h&e: The matrix of the columnar cartilage was immunolabelled with type II collagen antibody. Remnants of eosinophilic degenerated muscle fibers were interspersed among the cartilage. Inset: The type II colllagen immunoreactive areas displayed an heavy ALP activity. Bands of eosinophilic material stained partially by Von Kossa underlined some borders of the mineralized cartilage. These osteoid-like bands were lined by cells which morphologically appeared to be osteoblast-like cells. To confirm the osteoblastic nature of these cells, immunolabelling for OCN was performed (Fig  5c ). In front of the osteoblastic-like cells a consistent matricial OCN immunoreactivity was evident onto the eosinophilic matrix underlining the mineralized cartilage. We have also observed deposition of OCN into woven bone formed adjacent to cartilage. In order to document the collagenic composition of these tissues and confirm their osseous or cartilaginous nature, immunolabelling for type I, II and X collagens were performed. Conspicuous immunolabelling for type X collagen was observed in most of the hypertrophic chondrocytes and in their matrix. The immunoreactivity became more intense nearby the mineralization front. In addition the matrix of the fibrous and non cartilage-like tissue around some mineralized areas was unexpectedly labelled (Fig  5d ). Control samples in which primary antibody incubation was omitted were clearly negative (data not shown). Distribution of type II collagen was limited to the matrix of non hypertrophic and prehypertrophic chondrocytes with high ALP activity (Fig  5e ). Nevertheless some type II collagen immunoreactivity could sometimes be detected in the hypertrophic areas. Bone deposition was frequently observed by polarized light and confirmed by type I collagen immunostaining (Fig  6 ). Type I collagen was located in the osteoblast-containing matrix which formed and lined up along spicules of calcified cartilage. Osteocytes were trapped in the lamellar and woven bone with type I collagen immunoreactivity. Figure 6 Frozen section of soft tissue of a 24 months hip NPOA : Type I collagen immunolabelling counter stained by h&e: Type I collagen was the main constituant of the matrix in the primary osteons (OS) and non organized woven bone (W). Inset: lamellar bone deposition observed by polarized light b)Serial sections In order to determine the chronology of events at work in the described endochondral ossification, we performed serial cryosectioning of samples in which a cortical bone followed soft tissue. These samples seem to be appropriate to have all stages of osteogenesis One of the specimens appeared to contain an aponeurotic tissue which showed signs of bursitis. In a highly cellular tissue we observed a high angiogenic activity. Bundles of vessels surrounded amorphous and avascular zones (Fig  7a ). Some of these vessels expressed slight ALP activity which became more and more intense in the vicinity of the acellular areas. Then the avascular areas were replaced by nodules of cartilage with prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. These areas were stained by alcian blue pH1, showing chondroitin sulfate accumulation in their matrix (Fig  7b ). Figure 7 Serial sections of soft tissue of 24 months hip NPOA :  a:  ALP activity counter stained with nuclear red-eosin: Slide 118; Important angiogenesis encircles avascular areas. Many of these vessels express ALP activity (ALP+).  b:  Alcian bleu pH = 1 staining: Slide 70: chondroitin sulfate accumulation in cartilage.  c:  ALP activity counter stained with nuclear red-eosin: Slide 71.  d:  Von Kossa staining countre stained with h&e: Slide 65. At this stage a strong ALP activity was observed in the cells surrounding the cartilage zone as well as in non mineralized hypertrophic areas (Fig  7c ). Finally Von Kossa staining revealed the matrix mineralization (Fig  7d ). Immunolabelling of these sections with type II collagen antibody demonstrated a circle of prehypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig  8a ). The matrix of the fibrous tissue outside this mineralized nodule was immunoreactive to type I collagen antibody (Fig  8b ). Type X collagen recovered the nodule of hypertrophic chondrocytes and the rest of this section showing a high osteogenic activity (Fig  8c ). OCN immunolabelling revealed exactly the same zone stained by Von Kossa showing deposition of OCN on mineralized zone (Fig  8d ). As previously described OCN was detected in the osteoblast-like cells lining the newly lay down osteoid as well as in the newly formed woven bone and on areas of membranous bone formation (Fig  8e ). OCN was also observed in some cells around the vessels near by the areas of osteogenesis. Figure 8 Immunological study of serial sections :  a:  Type II Collagen immunolabellingcountre stained with h&e: Slide 69: Type II collagen had the same pattern of ALP activity of nodule showing prehypertrophic chondrocytes in nonmineralized zone.  b:  Type I collagen Immunolabelling countre stained with h&e: Slide 72; Type I collagen expression encercled the mineralized nodule.  c:  Type X collagen immunolabelling countre stained with h&e:Slide 73: Type X collagen was expressed by most of cells and distributed in their matrix.  d:  OCN Immunolabelling countre stained with h&e: Slide 64: OCN was expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes.  e:  OCN immunolabelling counter stained with h&e: Activated osteoblasts (OB) and woven bone (W) are strongly labelled. Some capillaries (C) near by these areas express osteocaline too.  f:  VEGF immunolabelling counter stained with h&e: VEGF was expressed by some hypertrophic chondrocytes (H). Activated and non activated osteoblasts-like cells (OB) lining the cartilage express also VEGF. Inset: Clustered and isolated cells in the matrix, surrounding hypertrophic chondrocytes, which could be destinated to capillary or osteoblast formation, are also labelled by VEGF. To further confirm the process of endochondral ossification, we decided to search for VEGF expression. Immunolabelling of these tissues with VEGF monoclonal antibody, showed a labelling of the hypertrophic chondrocytes as well as an intense labelling of activated osteoblats lining the osteoid. Some clusters of rounded cells also expressed VEGF in the fibrous part of these preparations (Fig  8f ). c)Ultrasound examination and digital radiographs of suspected NPOA US examination showed a huge focal disorganization of the muscles in the area of the suspected NPOA. Normal longitudinal muscular striation disappeared and was replaced by a relatively well defined mass with a very heterogeneous echostructure. The masses ranged from six to eleven centimeters of long axis. No scattered ossified areas were detected by US at this stage. Hypervascularization was detected on Doppler examination inside and outside the NPOA tumors (Fig  9a ). Figure 9 Ultrasound and color Doppler examination and digital radiographs of suspected NPOA  a:  Axial US view combined with color Doppler of the anterior side of the left hip in a paraplegic patient presenting acute limitation and inflammation of this joint. The striation of the psoas iliaque muscle, normally detectable at the anterior part of the hip joint with US examination, has disappeared. A relatively well defined mass (orange arrows) is detectable at the anterior part of the left femoral head (F). This mass is very heterogeneous with mixed hypo and hyper echoic areas. Color Doppler enables visualization of vessels in the mass (red and blue Doppler signals). A mass effect is visible on the femoral vessels (top right of the view).  b:  Same patient, one week later, axial US view of the posterior side of the left hip. The classical zone phenomenon (ZP) is detectable with a central hypoechoic area surrounded by hyper echoic nodules with posterior attenuation(black arrows).  c:  Axial US examination at the same day combined with color Doppler view of the posterior side of the left hip. A posterior mass (orange arrows) is also visible in the gluteal muscles, very heterogeneous with mixed hypo and hyper echoic areas. Color Doppler reveals large vessels in the mass (red and blue Doppler signals).  d:  Plain radiographs of the left hip obtained the same day as first US examination: Any sign of ossification is visible while a well defined mass is detected by US examination.  e:  Plain radiographs of the left hip obtained two weeks after: Early anterior and posterior NPOA ossification is only slightly visible two weeks (Orange arrows) after the initial clinical signs whereas the US examination was initially positive. Classical zone phenomenon previously described in the literature [ 15 , 16 ] was visible with a central hypo echoic area surrounded by small (less than one centimeter) hyper echoic nodules with posterior attenuation (Fig  9b ). At this stage color Doppler examination showed increasing angiogenesis with the appearance of large vessels in the tumor mass (Fig  9c ). The zone phenomenon became visible on the second US examination performed one week later (Fig  9d ). The opacity of the early ossification became slightly visible on plain films only two weeks after the US detection of zone phenomenon (Fig  9e ).\\nResults\\na)Histological and immunohistological studies Non mineralized connective tissues from the periphery of the osteoma were examined by light microscopy on Erlich\\'s hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections.

Figure 2 a: Frozen section of soft tissue from a 72 months hip NPOA : Hematoxylin eosin (h&e): Thrombotic vessels (V), more or less advanced vacuolization/degeneration of muscular fibers (M), and adipous tissue (A).  b:  Oil Red-O staining : Degenerated muscle fibers (M) stained by eosin were embedded in a strongly hyperplastic perimysium.

Figure 3 Frozen sections of soft tissue of an 8 months hip NPOA : Blue Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity counter stained with nuclear red-eosin: perivascular cells show high ALP activity near by vessels (V) and some of these seems to migrate from these areas. Inset: Cluster and isolated rounded cells (C) with high ALP showed a more advanced stage of differentiation. These findings point to a chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation of formerly undifferentiated mesenchymal cells from the stroma and the vessel walls. More advanced stages of cartilaginous differentiation were frequently observed in avascular areas with varying degrees of chondrocyte maturation. Morphologically recognizable columns of chondrocyte-like cells presenting a high ALP activity were observed. Moreover, we could observe all the stages of progressive chondrocyte differentiation from quiescence to chondrocyte hypertrophy/matrix mineralization and endochondral ossification (Fig  4 ). Figure 4 Frozen section of soft tissue of an 8 months hip NPOA : Blue Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity counter stained with nuclear red-eosin: The successive stage of chondrocytes differentiation were observed: quiescent (Q), proliferative (P), prehypertrophic (D), hypertrophic (H) and mineralization zones. Inset: Lamellar bone deposition (L) is visualized with polarized light. A high ALP activity was also found in cells surrounding the cartilage areas undergoing mineralization and embedded in a slight envelope of woven bone with ALP positive cells (Fig  5a ). On the other hand, ALP activity of hypertrophic chondrocytes was progressively lost as mineralization occurred, thus Von Kossa staining seemed to be a negative image of ALP activity (Fig  5b ). Figure 5 Frozen sections of soft tissue of a 5 months elbow NPOA :  a:  Blue Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity counter stained by nuclear red-eosin: A very strong ALP activity in multilayered cells surrounded a peripherically mineralized area. This area was made of woven bone (W) deposed on an hypertrophic cartilage (H) centered by prehypertrophic chondrocytes. Hypertrophic and prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the non-mineralized matrix displayed ALP activity.  b:  Vonkossa staining of a next section counter stained by h&e: Von Kossa stain was a negative image of the ALP activity. Osteoid matrix was deposed upon the calcified cartilage matrix and underwent mineralization. Palissade-arranged cells lined this osteoid and displayed morphological image of osteoblast-like cells (OB).  c:  Oscteocalcin immunolabelling of a next section of the same specimen counter stained by h&e: Osteocalcin immunoreactivity in the eosinophilic osteoid at the border of the mineralized woven bone and sligtly on osteoblast-like cells (OB) lining this zone. Slight labelling was also present in the woven bone (W), but not in the cartilage (C) areas.  d:  Type X collagen immunolabelling of a next section of the same specimen counter stained by h&e: Type X collagen immunoreactivity was found in the mineralized cartilage area up to the woven bone. It also streched over most of the fibrous tissue (F) surrounding the mineralized area. Inset: It was also present in hypertrophic chondrocytes and their matrix.  e:  Type II collagen immunolabelling of this specimen conter stain by h&e: The matrix of the columnar cartilage was immunolabelled with type II collagen antibody. Remnants of eosinophilic degenerated muscle fibers were interspersed among the cartilage. Inset: The type II colllagen immunoreactive areas displayed an heavy ALP activity. Bands of eosinophilic material stained partially by Von Kossa underlined some borders of the mineralized cartilage. These osteoid-like bands were lined by cells which morphologically appeared to be osteoblast-like cells. To confirm the osteoblastic nature of these cells, immunolabelling for OCN was performed (Fig  5c ). In front of the osteoblastic-like cells a consistent matricial OCN immunoreactivity was evident onto the eosinophilic matrix underlining the mineralized cartilage. We have also observed deposition of OCN into woven bone formed adjacent to cartilage. In order to document the collagenic composition of these tissues and confirm their osseous or cartilaginous nature, immunolabelling for type I, II and X collagens were performed. Conspicuous immunolabelling for type X collagen was observed in most of the hypertrophic chondrocytes and in their matrix. The immunoreactivity became more intense nearby the mineralization front. In addition the matrix of the fibrous and non cartilage-like tissue around some mineralized areas was unexpectedly labelled (Fig  5d ). Control samples in which primary antibody incubation was omitted were clearly negative (data not shown). Distribution of type II collagen was limited to the matrix of non hypertrophic and prehypertrophic chondrocytes with high ALP activity (Fig  5e ). Nevertheless some type II collagen immunoreactivity could sometimes be detected in the hypertrophic areas. Bone deposition was frequently observed by polarized light and confirmed by type I collagen immunostaining (Fig  6 ). Type I collagen was located in the osteoblast-containing matrix which formed and lined up along spicules of calcified cartilage. Osteocytes were trapped in the lamellar and woven bone with type I collagen immunoreactivity. Figure 6 Frozen section of soft tissue of a 24 months hip NPOA : Type I collagen immunolabelling counter stained by h&e: Type I collagen was the main constituant of the matrix in the primary osteons (OS) and non organized woven bone (W). Inset: lamellar bone deposition observed by polarized light\\na)Histological and immunohistological studies\\nNon mineralized connective tissues from the periphery of the osteoma were examined by light microscopy on Erlich\\'s hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. Several kinds of tissues appeared on the slides so the diversity of these figures deserves a systematic analysis which will be completed in the next sections. Briefly, the ground basis of our preparations was a more or less fibro-cellular connective tissue displaying sometimes edema and/or necrosis. Suffering and degenerating tissues with vacuolized myofibers, thrombotic vessels and adipose tissue were often observed (Fig  2a ). Muscular tissue underwent degeneration as shown by the vacuolisation or the disappearance of the internal eosinophily. Oil red-O stained adipocytes in the vicinity of some degenerating muscle with hyperplastic endomysium and perimysium (Fig  2b ). In these regions, ALP activity was detected in the endomysium and perimysium cells of degenerated muscles (Fig  2b , inset).Morphologically normal vessels were rarely observed and winding of the vasculature was an almost constant finding. Many of the vessels were thrombotic, sometimes with hyperplastic intimae or media (Fig  2c ). Some perivascular cells showed ALP activity and seemed to migrate out from these proliferating zones (Fig  3 ). Clustered or isolated round cells with high ALP activity were also observed embedded in a high amount of collagen matrix (Fig  3 , inset).These findings point to a chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation of formerly undifferentiated mesenchymal cells from the stroma and the vessel walls. More advanced stages of cartilaginous differentiation were frequently observed in avascular areas with varying degrees of chondrocyte maturation. Morphologically recognizable columns of chondrocyte-like cells presenting a high ALP activity were observed. Moreover, we could observe all the stages of progressive chondrocyte differentiation from quiescence to chondrocyte hypertrophy/matrix mineralization and endochondral ossification (Fig  4 ).A high ALP activity was also found in cells surrounding the cartilage areas undergoing mineralization and embedded in a slight envelope of woven bone with ALP positive cells (Fig  5a ). On the other hand, ALP activity of hypertrophic chondrocytes was progressively lost as mineralization occurred, thus Von Kossa staining seemed to be a negative image of ALP activity (Fig  5b ).Bands of eosinophilic material stained partially by Von Kossa underlined some borders of the mineralized cartilage. These osteoid-like bands were lined by cells which morphologically appeared to be osteoblast-like cells.To confirm the osteoblastic nature of these cells, immunolabelling for OCN was performed (Fig  5c ). In front of the osteoblastic-like cells a consistent matricial OCN immunoreactivity was evident onto the eosinophilic matrix underlining the mineralized cartilage. We have also observed deposition of OCN into woven bone formed adjacent to cartilage.In order to document the collagenic composition of these tissues and confirm their osseous or cartilaginous nature, immunolabelling for type I, II and X collagens were performed.Conspicuous immunolabelling for type X collagen was observed in most of the hypertrophic chondrocytes and in their matrix. The immunoreactivity became more intense nearby the mineralization front. In addition the matrix of the fibrous and non cartilage-like tissue around some mineralized areas was unexpectedly labelled (Fig  5d ). Control samples in which primary antibody incubation was omitted were clearly negative (data not shown).Distribution of type II collagen was limited to the matrix of non hypertrophic and prehypertrophic chondrocytes with high ALP activity (Fig  5e ). Nevertheless some type II collagen immunoreactivity could sometimes be detected in the hypertrophic areas.Bone deposition was frequently observed by polarized light and confirmed by type I collagen immunostaining (Fig  6 ). Type I collagen was located in the osteoblast-containing matrix which formed and lined up along spicules of calcified cartilage. Osteocytes were trapped in the lamellar and woven bone with type I collagen immunoreactivity.b)Serial sections In order to determine the chronology of events at work in the described endochondral ossification, we performed serial cryosectioning of samples in which a cortical bone followed soft tissue. These samples seem to be appropriate to have all stages of osteogenesis One of the specimens appeared to contain an aponeurotic tissue which showed signs of bursitis. In a highly cellular tissue we observed a high angiogenic activity. Bundles of vessels surrounded amorphous and avascular zones (Fig  7a ). Some of these vessels expressed slight ALP activity which became more and more intense in the vicinity of the acellular areas. Then the avascular areas were replaced by nodules of cartilage with prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. These areas were stained by alcian blue pH1, showing chondroitin sulfate accumulation in their matrix (Fig  7b ). Figure 7 Serial sections of soft tissue of 24 months hip NPOA :  a:  ALP activity counter stained with nuclear red-eosin: Slide 118; Important angiogenesis encircles avascular areas. Many of these vessels express ALP activity (ALP+).  b:  Alcian bleu pH = 1 staining: Slide 70: chondroitin sulfate accumulation in cartilage.  c:  ALP activity counter stained with nuclear red-eosin: Slide 71.  d:  Von Kossa staining countre stained with h&e: Slide 65. At this stage a strong ALP activity was observed in the cells surrounding the cartilage zone as well as in non mineralized hypertrophic areas (Fig  7c ). Finally Von Kossa staining revealed the matrix mineralization (Fig  7d ). Immunolabelling of these sections with type II collagen antibody demonstrated a circle of prehypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig  8a ). The matrix of the fibrous tissue outside this mineralized nodule was immunoreactive to type I collagen antibody (Fig  8b ). Type X collagen recovered the nodule of hypertrophic chondrocytes and the rest of this section showing a high osteogenic activity (Fig  8c ). OCN immunolabelling revealed exactly the same zone stained by Von Kossa showing deposition of OCN on mineralized zone (Fig  8d ). As previously described OCN was detected in the osteoblast-like cells lining the newly lay down osteoid as well as in the newly formed woven bone and on areas of membranous bone formation (Fig  8e ). OCN was also observed in some cells around the vessels near by the areas of osteogenesis. Figure 8 Immunological study of serial sections :  a:  Type II Collagen immunolabellingcountre stained with h&e: Slide 69: Type II collagen had the same pattern of ALP activity of nodule showing prehypertrophic chondrocytes in nonmineralized zone.  b:  Type I collagen Immunolabelling countre stained with h&e: Slide 72; Type I collagen expression encercled the mineralized nodule.  c:  Type X collagen immunolabelling countre stained with h&e:Slide 73: Type X collagen was expressed by most of cells and distributed in their matrix.  d:  OCN Immunolabelling countre stained with h&e: Slide 64: OCN was expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes.  e:  OCN immunolabelling counter stained with h&e: Activated osteoblasts (OB) and woven bone (W) are strongly labelled. Some capillaries (C) near by these areas express osteocaline too.  f:  VEGF immunolabelling counter stained with h&e: VEGF was expressed by some hypertrophic chondrocytes (H). Activated and non activated osteoblasts-like cells (OB) lining the cartilage express also VEGF. Inset: Clustered and isolated cells in the matrix, surrounding hypertrophic chondrocytes, which could be destinated to capillary or osteoblast formation, are also labelled by VEGF. To further confirm the process of endochondral ossification, we decided to search for VEGF expression. Immunolabelling of these tissues with VEGF monoclonal antibody, showed a labelling of the hypertrophic chondrocytes as well as an intense labelling of activated osteoblats lining the osteoid. Some clusters of rounded cells also expressed VEGF in the fibrous part of these preparations (Fig  8f ).\\nb)Serial sections\\nIn order to determine the chronology of events at work in the described endochondral ossification, we performed serial cryosectioning of samples in which a cortical bone followed soft tissue.

Some clusters of rounded cells also expressed VEGF in the fibrous part of these preparations (Fig  8f ).c)Ultrasound examination and digital radiographs of suspected NPOA US examination showed a huge focal disorganization of the muscles in the area of the suspected NPOA. Normal longitudinal muscular striation disappeared and was replaced by a relatively well defined mass with a very heterogeneous echostructure. The masses ranged from six to eleven centimeters of long axis. No scattered ossified areas were detected by US at this stage. Hypervascularization was detected on Doppler examination inside and outside the NPOA tumors (Fig  9a ). Figure 9 Ultrasound and color Doppler examination and digital radiographs of suspected NPOA  a:  Axial US view combined with color Doppler of the anterior side of the left hip in a paraplegic patient presenting acute limitation and inflammation of this joint. The striation of the psoas iliaque muscle, normally detectable at the anterior part of the hip joint with US examination, has disappeared. A relatively well defined mass (orange arrows) is detectable at the anterior part of the left femoral head (F). This mass is very heterogeneous with mixed hypo and hyper echoic areas. Color Doppler enables visualization of vessels in the mass (red and blue Doppler signals). A mass effect is visible on the femoral vessels (top right of the view).  b:  Same patient, one week later, axial US view of the posterior side of the left hip. The classical zone phenomenon (ZP) is detectable with a central hypoechoic area surrounded by hyper echoic nodules with posterior attenuation(black arrows).  c:  Axial US examination at the same day combined with color Doppler view of the posterior side of the left hip. A posterior mass (orange arrows) is also visible in the gluteal muscles, very heterogeneous with mixed hypo and hyper echoic areas. Color Doppler reveals large vessels in the mass (red and blue Doppler signals).  d:  Plain radiographs of the left hip obtained the same day as first US examination: Any sign of ossification is visible while a well defined mass is detected by US examination.  e:  Plain radiographs of the left hip obtained two weeks after: Early anterior and posterior NPOA ossification is only slightly visible two weeks (Orange arrows) after the initial clinical signs whereas the US examination was initially positive. Classical zone phenomenon previously described in the literature [ 15 , 16 ] was visible with a central hypo echoic area surrounded by small (less than one centimeter) hyper echoic nodules with posterior attenuation (Fig  9b ). At this stage color Doppler examination showed increasing angiogenesis with the appearance of large vessels in the tumor mass (Fig  9c ). The zone phenomenon became visible on the second US examination performed one week later (Fig  9d ). The opacity of the early ossification became slightly visible on plain films only two weeks after the US detection of zone phenomenon (Fig  9e ).\\nc)Ultrasound examination and digital radiographs of suspected NPOA\\nUS examination showed a huge focal disorganization of the muscles in the area of the suspected NPOA.

The masses ranged from six to eleven centimeters of long axis. No scattered ossified areas were detected by US at this stage. Hypervascularization was detected on Doppler examination inside and outside the NPOA tumors (Fig  9a ).Classical zone phenomenon previously described in the literature [ 15 , 16 ] was visible with a central hypo echoic area surrounded by small (less than one centimeter) hyper echoic nodules with posterior attenuation (Fig  9b ).

In this study we postulated that periosteoma soft tissues display interrupted early stages of osteoma formation, which could help us to understand the chronology as well as the mechanism of osteoma formation. Thus, histological and immunohistological experiments were performed on 28 specimens. Moreover, ultrasound examination of suspected NPOA tumor on five patients permitted to follow osteoma formation in the early stages before ossification. Histological studies have shown varying amount of muscle and connective tissue degeneration in which some areas underwent reorganization. Islands of cartilage, woven bone, and mature lamellar bone were a constant finding in most of specimens, whatever the estimated age of the studied lesion. The spatial organization of chondrocytes was reminiscent of the epiphyseal growth plate or of the fracture callus organization [ 17 ]. In the developmental pathway leading to skeletogenesis, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells pass sequentially through at least four differentiation stages: committed mesenchymal cells which produce type I collagen and possibly basal level of type II collagen, quiescent chondrocytes, then proliferating chondrocytes characterized by the synthesis of a large amount of type II collagen and sulfated proteoglycans, and ultimately hypertrophic chondrocytes characterized by the synthesis of type X collagen. Then these hypertrophic chondrocytes allow the mineralization of the matrix elaborated and induce vascular invasion by releasing VEGF [ 18 , 19 ]. Studies of our specimens showed the same sequence of events. These results suggest that endochondral osteogenesis is the major pathway in the NPOA bone formation. Nevertheless in view of some features suggesting bone deposition without any cartilage scaffold we cannot exclude the occurrence of membranous bone formation. Some sections showed a high expression of type X collagen in the hypertrophic chondrocytes areas, and unexpectedly in non differentiated mesenchymal tissue. As this labelling did not occur in other fibrocellular areas it was unlikely to be produced by a binding of the antibody to some other matricial component of the extra cellular matrix. It was shown, that type X collagen is not only associated with chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, but also with resting chondrocytes, cells at the border of the perichondrium and resting cartilage of the fetal femoral head [ 20 ]. The finding of still degenerating muscular fibers and early chondro-osteogenesis accompanied by heavy ALP activity in large parts of the soft tissues in old lesions (till 8 years) is singular. Except when serial sectioning was performed the studied specimens were carefully dissected from the osteoma during the surgery or at the fixation time. Therefore the extra-osteoma localization of these tissues can without any doubt be assumed. In one study [ 21 ] \"recent POA\" was described as a kind of fibrocellular tissue including vascular stasis, overabundance of micro vessels, myolysis, edematous fibrocellular tissue, with chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and lamellar bone apposition on mineralized structures. This description of \"recent POA\" is perfectly in agreement with our description of the periosteoma tissues. However, we found each of these elements notwithstanding the advanced age of some lesions. Most of our specimens contained clusters of ALP positive cells in the undifferentiated fibrous connective tissue, suggesting the presence of preosteogenic cells. This fact and the presence of cartilage and bone at varying stages of maturity are indicative of a persistent chondro-osteogenic activity in these tissues. This point sounds of interest as regards to contingencies of heterotopic bone formation relapse following surgical excision. The occurrence of relapses was reported to correlate neither to the classical criteria of osteoma maturation nor to the amount of heterotopic bone left after excision nor to the age of the lesion [ 22 - 24 ]. The occurrence of relapses could be linked to the activation of the still process. It was claimed that osteoma develops in the periphery of a muscle in which some myofibers undergo degeneration [ 25 , 26 ], and that osteoma involves the muscles. However the endochondral process of bone formation described here is in agreement with the results of various bone induction experiments in muscle [ 27 - 30 ]. Moreover, US examination of suspected NPOA tumor at the early stage showed huge focal disorganisation of muscle surrounding the hip joint and disappearance of normal longitudinal muscular striation of the psoas iliaque muscle replaced by masses with heterogeneous echostructure. This finding argues in favour of an intramuscular beginning of the process. We could not set up the place and part of the muscle degeneration process in the heterotopic bone formation. Though the process described here resembles by some aspects the Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) where endochondral ossification was demonstrated in muscle and adjacent connective tissue [ 31 , 32 ]. These reports combined with our finding of endomysium-perimysium hyperplasia in the degenerating muscles with ALP activity and US result, could suggest a role for the muscular tissue and especially mesenchymal cells from endomysium and perimysium in the setting of the heterotopic bone formation process. Vascular disorders, such as vascular disruption or compression [ 33 ] and venous stasis together with a cascade of inflammatory reactions including release of enzymes from necrotic tissues and α-adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction, lead to the formation of hypoxic zones beneath the nervous injury. On the other hand it has been shown that hypoxia promotes chondrocyte differentiation [ 34 , 35 ]. In our specimens, high amount of thrombotic vessels were indicative of the hypoxic status of these tissues. Color Doppler examination of tumor during the first clinical signs of NPOA, showed an avascular area in which some vessels appeared. These signals became more intense one week later. This tends to confirm hypoxic status of the initial lesion. This suggests that a timely defined hypoxic condition in tissue induces chondrocytes differentiation. The volume of the tumor is acquired during the very early stages of NPOA. After tumefaction there is no real change in the tumor size [ 2 ]. Moreover chondrocytes in the hypertrophic stage increase volume 10 times [ 36 ]. So the chondrocyte hypertrophy could be the cause of the tumefaction and so determines the final size of the tumor. Then, the related vascular sign occurs and color Doppler showed the first sign of increasing angiogenesis. On tissue section, VEGF immunolabelling revealed a more intense expression by osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cells, in addition to its expected expression by hypertrophic chondrocytes. VEGF induces neoangiogenesis and then endochondral ossification occurs. The restoration of normoxic conditions promote the onset of lamellar ossification and hamper any other  de novo  cartilaginous differentiation. US examination of the same NPOA tumor one week later showed scattered ossifying nodules. This nodular activity is in accordance with our histological finding in periosteoma soft tissue. Extense of the hypoxic area determines the size of each nodule. Areas with important hypoxia induce larger cartilage zones which could join together after ossification but small nodules remain scattered in periosteoma soft tissue. These results confirm that, periosteoma soft tissue has the same pattern of early stage of osteoma ossification, and could be a model of ossification for further studies. Moreover, NPOA occurs in neurologically deficient patients with altered mechanical loading. Mechanical loading is of pivotal importance to the development, function and repair of all tissues in the musculoskeletal system. In nonfunctional joints, as it is the case of these patients, the absence or reduction of intermittent hydrostatic pressure in the articular cartilage could permit cartilage degeneration and the progressive advance of the ossification These mechanical influence could indeed shed light on the finding that osteomas only occur near the main joints.[ 37 ] Moreover, Carter and associates have also shown that intermittently applied shear stresses (or strain energy) promote endochondral ossification and that intermittently applied hydrostatic compression inhibits or prevents cartilage degeneration and ossification. Thus, the imbalance of these forces among these patients can promote endochondral ossification of the cartilage nodules in areas of high shear (deviatoric) stresses[ 38 ]. Urist demonstrated that the induced endochondral bone is resorbed once the inductive agent has disappeared [ 30 ]. We have not seen many osteoclasts nor other multinucleated cells in ours preparations, and the literature does not report on NPOA regression except in people under 15 years of age [ 39 ]. Therefore it would be interesting to study the regulation of osteoclasts and the remodelling in such model. We therefore propose a model of the NPOA lesion formation. The sympathetic hyperactivity causes major changes in the peripheral vascular dynamics. As related some of these changes end in vascular stasis and/or thrombosis [ 2 ]. Edema follows on in the connective tissue which sustains some amount of necrosis. The trauma, subsequent neurological conditions and perhaps systemic factors [ 40 , 41 ] induce major changes in these tissues. Regenerating celles under low oxygen pressure/high dilatational hydrostatic forces [ 34 , 42 , 43 ] transmogrify themselves into chondrogenic cells. Then cartilage differentiation gets moving on until hypertrophy of the chondrocytes and cartilage matrix mineralization. The cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the chondrocytes could account for the solid swelling clinically noticed soon after the onset of the clinical signs of NPOA. Like they did in the developing limb, some competent cells lining the cartilage rudiments undergo the osteoblastic differentiation and lay down osteoid on the cartilage. Concomitantly the cartilage hypertrophy induces angiogenesis, osteoid deposition, and some extent of cartilage resorption. Remodelling of the mineralized cartilage and woven bone occurs. The osteoma could then control the process and inhibit any further bone formation. Some questions remain which deserve further studies. Why do NPOAs form only around the main joints? Why are they not resorbed as does any intramuscularly implanted bone graft [ 44 ]. What freezes the osteoma bone growth and the process of bone formation? Studies are ongoing in order to find some clues about the regulation of this heterotopic bone formation.\\nDiscussion\\nNPOA pathogenesis is still poorly understood, and the exact environmental and humoral conditions underlying the ossifying process are not clear.

However the endochondral process of bone formation described here is in agreement with the results of various bone induction experiments in muscle [ 27 - 30 ]. Moreover, US examination of suspected NPOA tumor at the early stage showed huge focal disorganisation of muscle surrounding the hip joint and disappearance of normal longitudinal muscular striation of the psoas iliaque muscle replaced by masses with heterogeneous echostructure. This finding argues in favour of an intramuscular beginning of the process. We could not set up the place and part of the muscle degeneration process in the heterotopic bone formation. Though the process described here resembles by some aspects the Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) where endochondral ossification was demonstrated in muscle and adjacent connective tissue [ 31 , 32 ]. These reports combined with our finding of endomysium-perimysium hyperplasia in the degenerating muscles with ALP activity and US result, could suggest a role for the muscular tissue and especially mesenchymal cells from endomysium and perimysium in the setting of the heterotopic bone formation process.

So the chondrocyte hypertrophy could be the cause of the tumefaction and so determines the final size of the tumor. Then, the related vascular sign occurs and color Doppler showed the first sign of increasing angiogenesis.On tissue section, VEGF immunolabelling revealed a more intense expression by osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cells, in addition to its expected expression by hypertrophic chondrocytes. VEGF induces neoangiogenesis and then endochondral ossification occurs. The restoration of normoxic conditions promote the onset of lamellar ossification and hamper any other  de novo  cartilaginous differentiation. US examination of the same NPOA tumor one week later showed scattered ossifying nodules. This nodular activity is in accordance with our histological finding in periosteoma soft tissue. Extense of the hypoxic area determines the size of each nodule. Areas with important hypoxia induce larger cartilage zones which could join together after ossification but small nodules remain scattered in periosteoma soft tissue. These results confirm that, periosteoma soft tissue has the same pattern of early stage of osteoma ossification, and could be a model of ossification for further studies.de novoMoreover, NPOA occurs in neurologically deficient patients with altered mechanical loading. Mechanical loading is of pivotal importance to the development, function and repair of all tissues in the musculoskeletal system. In nonfunctional joints, as it is the case of these patients, the absence or reduction of intermittent hydrostatic pressure in the articular cartilage could permit cartilage degeneration and the progressive advance of the ossification These mechanical influence could indeed shed light on the finding that osteomas only occur near the main joints.[ 37 ]Moreover, Carter and associates have also shown that intermittently applied shear stresses (or strain energy) promote endochondral ossification and that intermittently applied hydrostatic compression inhibits or prevents cartilage degeneration and ossification. Thus, the imbalance of these forces among these patients can promote endochondral ossification of the cartilage nodules in areas of high shear (deviatoric) stresses[ 38 ].Urist demonstrated that the induced endochondral bone is resorbed once the inductive agent has disappeared [ 30 ]. We have not seen many osteoclasts nor other multinucleated cells in ours preparations, and the literature does not report on NPOA regression except in people under 15 years of age [ 39 ]. Therefore it would be interesting to study the regulation of osteoclasts and the remodelling in such model.We therefore propose a model of the NPOA lesion formation. The sympathetic hyperactivity causes major changes in the peripheral vascular dynamics. As related some of these changes end in vascular stasis and/or thrombosis [ 2 ]. Edema follows on in the connective tissue which sustains some amount of necrosis. The trauma, subsequent neurological conditions and perhaps systemic factors [ 40 , 41 ] induce major changes in these tissues. Regenerating celles under low oxygen pressure/high dilatational hydrostatic forces [ 34 , 42 , 43 ] transmogrify themselves into chondrogenic cells. Then cartilage differentiation gets moving on until hypertrophy of the chondrocytes and cartilage matrix mineralization. The cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the chondrocytes could account for the solid swelling clinically noticed soon after the onset of the clinical signs of NPOA. Like they did in the developing limb, some competent cells lining the cartilage rudiments undergo the osteoblastic differentiation and lay down osteoid on the cartilage. Concomitantly the cartilage hypertrophy induces angiogenesis, osteoid deposition, and some extent of cartilage resorption. Remodelling of the mineralized cartilage and woven bone occurs. The osteoma could then control the process and inhibit any further bone formation.Some questions remain which deserve further studies. Why do NPOAs form only around the main joints? Why are they not resorbed as does any intramuscularly implanted bone graft [ 44 ]. What freezes the osteoma bone growth and the process of bone formation? Studies are ongoing in order to find some clues about the regulation of this heterotopic bone formation.Conclusion In conclusion, our results demonstrate that periosteoma soft tissues are a replica of the early stages of osteoma formation, and could be used as a model for NPOA formation. We propose also a mechanism for osteoma formation in which hypoxia is a major cause of nodular osteoinduction and chondrocyte differentiation. Combination of hypoxia and applied shear stresses induce endochodral ossification. Finally our results indicate implication of different types of mesenchymal cells in NPOA formation but US examination support specially muscular origin hypothesis.\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that periosteoma soft tissues are a replica of the early stages of osteoma formation, and could be used as a model for NPOA formation.
